# Phase-field model validation

## 1-D melting from a hot boundary: phase-field parameters

We begin by investigating the model parameters $A$ and $C$ introduced by the phase-field method.
As a reminder, the governing equation for the phase field $\phi$ takes the form

$$
\partial_t \phi = \frac{A}{Pe_T} \nabla^2 \phi - \frac{A}{\varepsilon Pe_T} \phi (1 - \phi) (1 - 2\phi + C(T - T_m)) ,
$$

so $A$ represents the diffusion coefficient of the phase field, and $C$ captures the strength of the coupling between the temperature field and the phase field.

Since the thermal coupling term is premultiplied by $1/\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is equal to the refined grid spacing, its magnitude can become very large.
This can cause numerical instability of the phase-field equation if the time step is too large.
From testing the [1-D melting example](examples/stefan.md) for a range of values of $A$ and $C$, we find the following restrictions for the time step:

$A$  | $C$ | ${\Delta t}_\mathrm{max}$
:--: | :-: | :------------------------
1    | 1   | $10^{-3}$
1    | 10  | $2\times 10^{-4}$
1    | 100 | $2\times 10^{-5}$
0.1  | 1   | $10^{-2}$
0.1  | 10  | $2\times 10^{-3}$
0.1  | 100 | $2\times 10^{-4}$
0.01 | 1   | $10^{-1}$
0.01 | 10  | $2\times 10^{-2}$
0.01 | 100 | $2\times 10^{-3}$

These tests were all performed with $Pe_T=10^3$, with a base resolution of $N_x = 512$ and a refined grid resolution of $N_x^r = 1024$.
It is clear from these results that the prefactor $AC/\varepsilon Pe_T$ constrains the maximum possible time step.

With that in mind, let us now consider how the values of $A$ and $C$ affect the accuracy of the results produced by the phase-field method.

First, we consider the position of the phase boundary over time.
The analytic solution for the phase boundary height is

$$
h(t) = 2\Lambda \sqrt{(t+t_0)/Pe_T} ,
$$

where $\Lambda = 0.62$ for $\mathcal{S}=1$, and $t_0$ is a value such that $h(0)=0.1$.
In the below figure, we plot the analytic solution against the position of $\phi=0.5$ for the phase-field model with $0.01\leq A\leq 1$ and $1\leq C \leq 100$.

Visually, it is clear that issues can arise if $AC < 1$.
Higher values of $C$, that more strongly impose the melting temperature at the phase boundary, provide excellent agreement with the analytic solution.
Indeed, the simulation with $A=0.01$, $C=100$ appears indistinguishable from the true solution.
Note that the simulation with $A=1$, $C=100$ only reached time $t=20$ in a two hour wall time period because of the strict time step restriction discussed above.

Now we can take a closer look at the temperature profiles as we vary the parameters.
Below we plot the temperature profile $T(x,t)$ for a range of discrete times between $t=0$ and $t=100$.

{% include "melting_validation_temperature.html" %}

We now see why the phase boundary positions for $AC < 1$ were inaccurate.
In these cases, the temperature at the phase boundary deviates significantly from the melting temperature $T_m=0$, allowing temperatures in the solid phase ($\phi>0.5$) to increase.
The other cases (with $AC\geq 1$) show excellent agreement with the temperature in the liquid phase.

However on close inspection, we can see that the temperature in the solid phase can fall below zero for the cases with $AC>1$.
This is unphysical in a fundamentally diffusive system, so based on these results, we advise setting $AC=1$ in all simulations going forward.

## 1-D Freezing from a cold boundary: resolution study

Now we have a good idea of how the model parameters behave, we perform a convergence study to investigate how the accuracy of the simulation depends on the resolution, both of the base grid and the refined grid.
We consider the inverse problem to that above, where a liquid phase freezes from a cold boundary and a solidification front moves across the domain.
Thanks to the symmetry with the previous problem, the position of the phase boundary should be unchanged from that above.
Following the above results, we perform these tests with phase-field parameters fixed at $A=0.01$, $C=100$.
We vary the size of the base grid `nxm` between 64 and 512, and vary the size of the refined grid `nxmr` between 64 and 1024.

{% include "freezing_convergence_interface.html" %}

The results highlight the importance of high resolution for the phase-field variable.
Even for the lowest base resolution of $n_x=64$, we find that the phase-field model tracks the interface reasonably accurately if the refined grid is sufficiently large, say $n_x^r=512$.
Such a disparity between the resolutions does however result in some oscillations in the interface position due to the coupling between $\phi$ and the temperature field.
Such oscillations only appear significant when the refined grid is more than twice as fine as the base grid.

Inspection of the temperature profiles shows a similar trend, where under-resolution of the phase-field can lead to excessive diffusion at the phase boundary, and significant deviations from the melting temperature.

## 2-D Rayleigh-BeÃÅnard convection with a melting boundary

Now, we introduce an example where the evolution of the temperature field and the phase boundary are also coupled to the fluid flow.
This again follows a validation example used by [Favier et al. (2019)](), and details of the initial condition can be found on the [examples page](examples/coupled_flows.md).
The system consists of a fluid heated from below that underlies a solid phase.
The evolution of the system is shown in the following video:

We follow Favier et al. in performing a convergence study, taking into account the resolutions of the two grids separately.
The following plot presents the height of the phase boundary $\phi=0.5$ at the time $t=0.1 Pe$ for a range of resolutions.

{% include "melting_RBC_interface_convergence.html" %}

As in the previous cases, we see that the resolution of the phase field is most important for the accurate evolution of the phase boundary.
This highlights a key advantage of our multiple-resolution technique, where only the phase-field variable needs evolving on the largest grid.
The above figure presents results for the model parameters $A=0.01$, $C=100$.

Below, we vary the value of $A$ while keeping $AC=1$ fixed, with a resolution of $n_x=512$, $n_x^r=1024$.
We observe monotonic dependence of the interface position with $A$, but only small variations relative to those seen in the resolution study.
